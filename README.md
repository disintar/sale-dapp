## Toncli devs

This is Disintar new sale contract & the example of how dApps on Toncli can be done. Feel free to use this repository as
template for your dApps.

### How dApp on toncli works?

Toncli create `.json` file of build info for each smart contract since ` v0.0.5` version.
It can be founded [here](https://github.com/disintar/sale-dapp/blob/master/build/nft_sale.json)

We can use this file to grab info about smart contract and create JS application that will deploy it or read info about
this contract.

### How toncli tests works in CI&CD workflow?

Each commit to mater [trigger](https://github.com/disintar/sale-dapp/actions) Docker actions.
It's use `action.yml` & `.github/workflow/main.yml` to do it.

In docker file we define to
run [tests](https://github.com/disintar/sale-dapp/blob/c5f1e8ba36ddcff716d5666a07c38f5bead1a79a/Dockerfile#L7).
If for some reason it'll be failed - the action will also fail, and bad version of your contract willn't be in dApp.

### How to convert my toncli project to dApp?

1. Copy `action.yml` / `Dockerfile` / `entrypoint.sh` / `.github` / `dapp` folders to your project
2. Create soft link of your smart contract `.json` into public folder of `dapp` (now you can download it in JS code)
3. Create [GitHub PAT token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
and pass it to [action secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) as `GH_TOKEN`
4. Enable GitHub pages to `gh-pages` branch
5. Enjoy

Each commit will trigger action to run docker, that will push builded JS code to `gh-pages` branch
